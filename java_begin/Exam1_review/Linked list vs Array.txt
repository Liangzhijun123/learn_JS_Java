Arrays:
    - Use when you need fast access to elements by index.
    - Ideal for fixed-size collections where the size doesn't change often.
    - Better for scenarios where memory locality is important.

Linked Lists:
    - Use when you need frequent insertions and deletions.
    - Ideal for dynamic collections where the size changes frequently.
    - Useful when you don't need random access to elements.
