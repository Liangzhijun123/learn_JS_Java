1. Direct Access: Arrays vs. chatAT
    - accessing elements in an array is faster because is a direct memory access operation
    - charAT in a string invovles additional method call overhead
2. Efficiency for string reversal
    - Arrays: Using a character array can be more efficient for reversing a string because you can swap elements in place
    - Strings: reversing a string invovles creating a new StringBuilder or stringBuffer

Overall:
    - Arrays: more direct and efficient manipulation for tasks like string reversal
    - String: provide convenience and readability
