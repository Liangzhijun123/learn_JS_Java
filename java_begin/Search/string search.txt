String Search
- string searches invovle locating a substring within a string and returning the index of the starting location of the substring
- most approachesi nclude:
    - one is slow one is faster
    - using a sliding window on the string that is the size of the substring
    - representing the window and substring in some more compact fashion

Rabin Karp Alogirthm
- rather than alwats comparing the string window with the substring, only compare them when necessasry
- represent the substring and each string window using a hash function
    - only need to compute the substring hash once
    - compute hashes for each window as needed
- select a hash function that causes few collisions and can be computed efficiently
