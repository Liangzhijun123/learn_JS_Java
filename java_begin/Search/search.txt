- types of items you might search for:
    - records in a database
    - elements in a data structure
    - text in a file
    - keywords in a collection of web pages
- searching is often assisted by organizing the array first

Types of searches
- binary search tree
    - find a node or not in a tree in o(log2 n) time
- hashing
    - find a key/value pair in a hash map in o(1) time if perfect hashing
- array
    = finding a specific element within an array
- String searching
    - find a substring within a larger String
    - find a keyword or phrases within a document 

Array base searches
- most array base searches require that element are sorted prior to seraching to attain maximum efficiency
- worst case is o(log2 n) to o(n)

Iterpolation
- interpolation involves constr
