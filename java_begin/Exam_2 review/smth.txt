Algorithm Analysis
- Time complexity vs. execution time.

Search Algorithms
- Comparing brute force string search vs. Rabin-Karp string search; understand how/when each one does its comparisons.
- Computing hash values for Rabin-Karp.

Sorting Algorithms
- Describe why the mergesort algorithm has a complexity of O(n log2n).

Graph Algorithms
- Adjacency list vs. adjacency matrix.
- Given a graph, determine the result of running Dijkstra's algorithm on it.
